# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 3rd, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Working on Simon still. Still not working. More later. Take it step by step through debugger. Also, a little codewars. This made an hour.

**Thoughts:** Hard to solve a problem in one setting (the endless hours of free time I have at work) without internet (not at work).

### Day 2: January 4rd, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I did it! Fixed Simon last night--without internet, even (downloaded jQuery). Not responsive yet, so only looks good on >= laptop screen.  Will figure that out later.

**Thoughts:** Pleased.
